## Hi everyone!👨‍💻
I'm a frontend developer who began my programming journey by self-studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I hold a higher education degree. Additionally, I completed the "Frontend: Start" course by Aitilogy, and I've also trained on FreeCodeCamp and Stepik. I am currently working actively with Angular and React, applying my knowledge to my pet projects, and I'm eager to gain my first commercial experience by contributing to projects of any scale.

## Projects
One of my projects is already published on my page.
Several projects are in the final stages of preparation.
